# AutoEvent

AutoEvent is a lightweight and blazing fast event launcher built with [Neutralino](https://neutralino.js.org) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). It is currently in construction.

##Â Features

AutoEvent can notify you of upcoming events, while consumming close to no ram while running in the background. Clicking the alert will directly take you the the launch steps.

## Roadmap

Currently, a lot of features aren't present on certain platforms (ex: notifications and app focus don't work on linux and windows). This is due to the fact that the main dev (OrigamingWasTaken) is on MacOS, and can't develop for other OSes. So you are very welcome to help us implement the missing features!
